        "It is your first day after the big executive meeting at Tongass where you presented the results of your linear regression analysis. It was well received. The CEO even gave you a fist bump! (Per our experience this can actually happen if your CEO is cool.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Now the VP of In Store Sales wants to use your results to push for expanding the number of stores, but the VP of Onlines Sales is pushing back, saying the results are just correlational! (This VP took a stats class in their MBA program.)\n",
        "\n",
        "The VP of In Store Sales comes to your desk and asks: \"Isn't there some data science voodoo we can do to get better results and prove in store sales boost customer value?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "You reply \"Definitely! I am a causal inference wizard. But getting a straight answer will require me to run some experiments and possibly offer discounts to change customer behavior.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"My entire team is at your disposal. If we can show this, I will have the evidence I need to double store openings and turbo charge our growth.\", the VP of In Store Sales replies.\n",

        "You say, \"Wonderful. I'll get right to it!\"\n",

        "\n",
        "* We will work with the same data set as last week and use it to tackle instrumental variables and regression discontinuity through different experiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "* As before we attempt to strike a balance between providing concrete steps to follow and making room for exploration. That said, we encourage you to explore: The best way to become a causal inference expert is to attack a single problem from multiple angles to see how different modeling choices affect an analysis."
